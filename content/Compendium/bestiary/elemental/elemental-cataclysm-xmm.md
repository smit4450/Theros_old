## Elemental Cataclysm

*The End and Beginning of Ages*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Elemental Chaos)  
- **Treasure.** None  

Beyond the fringes of the Elemental Planes, primordial forces endlessly clash amid the Elemental Chaos. Within the vastness and violence of this realm rage elemental cataclysms, entities spawned from the raw forces of the multiverse and awash in dissonant elemental powers. These beings of primal conflict annihilate nearly all they encounter and seed the ruins left in their wake with the potential for new creations.

Elemental cataclysms rarely escape the Elemental Chaos. When they do, it is typically due to some planar disruption or the summons of nihilistic cultists. When they emerge on Material Plane worlds, elemental cataclysms create realm-altering trails of destruction, carelessly destroying cities and throwing whole nations into chaos. The rampages aren't random. Elemental cataclysms abhor anything that visibly mars nature, be it mines or monuments, fortresses or cities, but they vent their most intense rage on works of metal and clockwork. As they sow destruction, they howl condemnation and chant words of unmaking in the languages of the Inner Planes.

Little can stop an elemental cataclysm. Those that oppose one of these calamities often attempt to reverse the ritual that summoned it, coax it through a planar rift, or conjure another titan in hopes that the two destroy one another. These terrors leave a wake of ashes, floods, storms, and broken earth. But after these disasters recede, the land is imbued with new life or environmental changes. Roll on or choose a result from the Elemental Alterations table to inspire what changes emerge after an elemental cataclysm's destruction.
