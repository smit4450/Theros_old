# Lizardfolk Geomancer
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 197*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/elemental/img/lizardfolk.webp#right)  
Lizardfolk geomancers draw magic from the natural world, using it to protect their people and territories.

## Lizardfolk

*Reptilian Defenders of the Land*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Swamp  
- **Treasure.** Individual  

Lizardfolk dwell in wildernesses suffused with primal magic. While many lizardfolk are Humanoids with varied skills, some forge powerful bonds with the Elemental Plane of Earth, granting them magical connections to the cycle of growth and rebirth.
