## Air Elemental

*Primal Spirit of Wind and Storm*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Mountain, Planar (Elemental Plane of Air)  
- **Treasure.** None  

Energetic spirits from the Elemental Plane of Air, air elementals gather clouds and winds into ever-changing bodies with indistinct limbs and vague features. Beyond their home plane, these elementals might serve magic-users who conjure them, or they might congregate around nexuses of unbridled planar energy, such as wind-scoured mountain peaks or endless storms. In battle, air elementals batter enemies with powerful gusts or transform into whirlwinds to fling away foes.

Air elementals often have distinctive compositions. Roll on or choose a result from the Air Elemental Compositions table to inspire the elemental's appearance.

> What can withstand the storm's scream? The lightning's spear? The want of sweet breath? Air is the mightiest of elements—respect its power.
