## Barlgura

*Demon of Instinct and Primal Violence*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Barlguras are demons that embody brutality and killer instincts. They ruthlessly hunt creatures that enter their territories, whether such places are Abyssal wildernesses or locations where these demons have been conjured by wicked magic-users. Barlguras litter their territories with fiendish icons and terrifying evidence of their kills.

Barlguras cooperate with other demons, particularly other barlguras, so long as they have ample prey. Should a region be depleted of creatures to slaughter, these demons turn on one another in frays that can devastate vast expanses.

Barlguras vary in appearance, but all have powerful frames and hands capable of climbing swiftly and delivering crushing blows. If brute force isn't enough to overwhelm their foes, barlguras can use demonic magic to conjure terrifying illusions and grasping vines. Most barlguras resemble nightmarish apes, and some bear exaggerated versions of features of predators common to the lands the barlguras inhabit. Many embed trophies from past hunts in their demonic bodies.
