## Hezrou

*Demon of Obscenity and Outrage*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Hezrous compose the bulk of many demonic hordes. In croaking, reeking throngs, these ogre-size brutes seek to crush and consume foes. Their oozing hides are manifestations of embodied evils. Every few moments, patches of their slimy skins erupt with grotesque transformations such as rows of mismatched fangs, fungal growths, or half-formed features. These unsettling manifestations emerge, then roil away.

Hezrous serve more powerful demons, such as nalfeshnees and mariliths. They take the abuse and intimidation of these deadlier demons and pass it on to droves of weaker dretches and manes. This predictable brutality makes hezrous useful links in the chaotic structure of a demonic horde.

When on the Material Plane or otherwise left to their own devices, hezrous recklessly indulge in destructive, short-sighted rampages. Only magic and threats from more powerful masters can curb these demons' outrages and compel hezrous to pursue greater plots. Powerful spellcasters often use sinister coercions, spells like [Magic Circle](Compendium/spells/magic-circle-xphb.md) and [Planar Binding](Compendium/spells/planar-binding-xphb.md), or other magic to force hezrous to serve them. Roll on or choose a result from the Demonic Undertakings table to inspire how a magic-user might employ a hezrou or similar demon.
