# Gnoll Pack Lord
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 140*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/fiend/img/gnolls.webp#right)  
Rising above other gnolls with their viciousness and physical prowess, gnoll pack lords terrorize weaker gnolls into their service. These brutes drive other gnolls to acts of great violence, then claim the best of their servants' spoils.

## Gnolls

*Fiends in Feral Flesh*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill  
- **Treasure.** [Armaments](Compendium/tables/random-magic-items-armaments.md), Individual  

The first gnolls arose from hyenas that fed on flesh tainted by the Abyss. Their corruption and violence delighted the demon lord Yeenoghu, who encouraged their numbers and spread them across the multiverse. Ever since, gnolls have been the cackling servants of Yeenoghu, existing to cause ruin and to feast on what remains.

> Yeenoghu claims gnolls not as his brood but as maggots purposefully released to infest a despised carcass. They are a pernicious rot the Beast of Butchery spreads across mortal worlds. Whatever they once were, they were remade and are now his.
