## Nightmare

*Dread Steed of the Lower Planes*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Lower Planes)  
- **Treasure.** None  

Nightmares resemble horses with flaming manes, burning hooves, and smoldering eyes. They terrorize weaker creatures and often ally with denizens of the Underworld in committing evil acts. These supernatural horses can innately travel between the Underworld and the Material Plane, and many know the locations of portals to the Lower Plane.

Nightmares' speed, resilience, and ability to gallop between planes of existence make them steeds coveted by evildoers. Roll on or choose a result from the Nightmare Riders table to inspire what might employ a nightmare steed.
