## Yochlol

*Demon of Depraved Will*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** None  

Yochlols embody the pernicious will and infectious philosophies of the Abyss. In their rarely seen true forms, these noxious manipulators appear as ever-shifting masses of dripping tentacles and toxic flesh crowned by a single baleful eye. More often, though, yochlols take the form of spiders or zealous cultists. They use manipulative magic and dangerous rhetoric to spread demonic cults, corrupt the righteous, and further the plots of their fiendish overlords. They relish coercing the unwitting into furthering demonic plots and turning mortals against one another.

Most yochlols serve Lolth. The Demon Queen of Spiders claims all yochlols as minions and orders any yochlols that disagree destroyed. In rare cases, yochlols might serve other demon lords, particularly manipulative or changeable ones like Graz'zt, Juiblex, and Zuggtmoy.

Despite their service to demon lords, yochlols harbor their own vicious whims and ambitions. They might claim to speak for their overlords to further their own ambitions or seek to reveal rivals' selfish goals to gain standing with their demonic masters.
