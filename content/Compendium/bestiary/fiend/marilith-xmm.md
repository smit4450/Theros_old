## Marilith

*Demon of Cruelty and Viciousness*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** [Armaments](Compendium/tables/random-magic-items-armaments.md)  

Mariliths are six-armed, serpent-like demons that wield lethal, Abyss-forged blades. With these cursed weapons and experience from countless battles, they lead other demons to slaughter virtuous souls. They often command droves of weaker demons.
