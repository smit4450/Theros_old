## Bone Devil

*Devil of Dread and Obedience*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Nine Hells)  
- **Treasure.** [Implements](Compendium/tables/random-magic-items-implements.md)  

Bone devils are gaunt, nightmarish Fiends with pallid skin stretched tight over frames that combine human and insectile features. Also known as osyluths, these Fiends command weaker devils and other beings aligned with infernal legions. Bone devils ensure that the commands of hellish sovereigns are exacted efficiently and that non-devils fulfill their commitments to the Nine Hells. They slay those who renege on infernal deals, sending treacherous mortal souls to face unspeakable punishments.

When not serving their diabolical masters, bone devils tempt self-obsessed mortals with promises of other creatures' adulation and obedience. These devils prop up petty tyrants, helping them grow increasingly calloused and amoral.

Bone devils travel across the multiverse to fulfill diabolical orders. If left with no other choices, they might conscript mortals to aid them in their vicious goals. Roll on or choose a result from the Bone Devil Objectives table to inspire a bone devil's goals.

> Bone devils are just one of a thousand reasons never to make a deal with a devil, but they're a significant one. Break said deal, and it'll likely be one of these nightmares that drags you down to the Nine Hells.
