## Jackalwere

*Shape-Shifting Trickster of the Wilds*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Grassland  
- **Treasure.** Implements  

Indistinguishable from jackals in their natural form, jackalweres shape-shift to deceive others. These shape-shifters can take three forms: a jackal, a human, or a monstrous hybrid of the two. Jackalweres are easily mistaken for werewolves, but jackalweres aren't supernaturally afflicted—their jackal forms are their natural state. Jackalweres also possess magical gazes capable of putting foes to sleep, allowing jackalweres to play their tricks unimpeded or get the upper hand over threats.

Jackalweres dwell in inhospitable wildernesses and pride themselves on their cleverness. They take offense at those who travel through their lands without leaving a gift of treasure or fresh game. Roll on or choose a result from the Jackalwere Tricks table to inspire how a jackalwere repays such slights.
