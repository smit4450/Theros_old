## Ochre Jelly

*Multiplying Amoeboid Hunter*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Ochre jellies are giant, yellow-brown amoebas that digest organic creatures. They tirelessly hunt any prey smaller than themselves, oozing over, under, and around obstacles in their path. Once they overwhelm their quarry, these acidic slimes dissolve the flesh, hair, and scales of their prey, leaving behind clothing, equipment, treated leather, and bone.

If damaged by lightning or a slashing weapon, an ochre jelly splits in two. These smaller jellies work together to consume foes, but afterward they move on to hunt independently. Both eventually grow into full-size jellies.

What ochre jellies can't dissolve they leave behind. Roll on or choose a result from the Ochre Jelly Leftovers table to inspire such remains.
