# Gray Ooze
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 151. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/ooze/img/gray-oozes.webp#right)  
Gray oozes appear in areas affected by unpredictable magic. Magic-users who fail in their attempts to bind elemental spirits to the bodies of Constructs might also accidentally create gray oozes.

## Gray Oozes

*Hungry Slimes and Magical Failures*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Gray oozes are predatory, corrosive slimes that blend in with stony surroundings.
