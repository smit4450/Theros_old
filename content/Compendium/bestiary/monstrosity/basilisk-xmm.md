## Basilisk

*Reptilian Guardian with a Petrifying Gaze*

- **Habitat.** Mountain, Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Basilisks are ponderous predators with eight clawed legs, crystalline spines, and mighty jaws. Rather than chasing prey, they use their supernatural gaze to turn creatures to stone and then consume these victims at their leisure. While basilisks are most comfortable in subterranean lairs, many are captured and kept by unscrupulous folk seeking guardians for their treasures.

The remains of [Petrified](Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) creatures litter the area where a basilisk hunts. These might be mundane creatures or more unusual beings that had dire encounters with a basilisk. Roll on or choose a result from the [Petrified](Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) Basilisk Victims table to inspire the statues that might appear in a basilisk's hunting grounds. There is a 50 percent chance that any of these statues are missing limbs or broken into pieces.
