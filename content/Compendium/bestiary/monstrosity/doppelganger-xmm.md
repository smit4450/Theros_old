## Doppelganger

*Shape-Shifting Infiltrator*

- **Habitat.** Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Individual  

Doppelgangers are supernatural beings with the ability to shape-shift into any humanlike form. Their mind-reading abilities aid them in creating near-perfect disguises and plucking secrets from unguarded minds. Occasionally, doppelgangers use their shape-shifting ability in more overt ways, transforming into unsettling forms to frighten foes.

A doppelganger's agenda might relate to its mysterious magical origins or to more mercenary goals. Roll on or choose a result from the Doppelganger Deceptions table to inspire a doppelganger's plot.
