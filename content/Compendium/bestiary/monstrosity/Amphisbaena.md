# Amphisbaena
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 230, Mythic Odysseys of Theros*

Found in Danger at Dunwater, these strange reptiles have a head at either end of their serpentine bodies, each one equipped with venomous fangs. To move, an amphisbaena uses one head to grip the neck of its other head, forming a hoop that rolls over the ground.
