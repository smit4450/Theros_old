# Yuan-ti Malison (Type 2)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 343*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/img/yuan-ti-malison-type-2.webp#right)  
Malisons exhibit snakelike features that make them deadly in combat.

- **Type 2.** These malisons have human bodies, but they've replaced their arms with snakes.  

Malisons possesses deadly venom, which some manipulate into magical strikes. They can also shape-shift into snakes, helping them to position themselves for surprise attacks or to slither away with nary a trace.

## Yuan-ti

*Power-Hungry Serpentine Conspirators*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Forest, Swamp, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Relics  

Exploiting pacts with sinister supernatural forces, yuan-ti bargain away their humanity for the lethality and predatory deviousness of serpents. From hidden bastions, they manipulate rulers and the wealthy, seeking to control the world. Many yuan-ti possess venomous magic, which often manifests as fangs or striking serpents.

Yuan-ti have humanlike forms with a variety of horrifying serpentine transformations. Some have a scattering of reptilian scales, while others are giants that are more snake than human. Typically, the more snakelike yuan-ti are, the greater esteem they hold among their kind.

Yuan-ti might gain their reptilian features through dangerous supernatural rites. Roll on or choose a result from the Yuan-ti Transformations table to inspire how yuan-ti obtain their serpentine aspects.
