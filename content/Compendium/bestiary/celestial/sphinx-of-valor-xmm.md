# Sphinx of Valor
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 294*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/celestial/img/sphinx-of-valor.webp#right)  
Sphinxes of valor guard world-changing or dangerous secrets—evidence of weird truths, deadly Artifacts, and things that shouldn't exist. They inhabit hidden, magical sites and hold their duty above mortal life. If threatened, a sphinx of valor defends its charge with its supernaturally empowered roar and fierce strikes.

## Sphinxes

*Collectors and Keepers of Secrets*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Planar (Upper Planes)  
- **Treasure.** Arcana  

Sphinxes protect the secrets of the multiverse. Formed from the spirits of sages and explorers, sphinxes know the power of truth and the importance of preserving it. They share their wisdom only with those who prove themselves wise or overcome tests of worthiness, such as riddles or battles with dangerous beasts. Through their existences, sphinxes might change form as they gain more nuanced understanding of cosmic enigmas.

### Sphinx Lairs

Sphinxes typically dwell in places that hold great knowledge or prophetic magic.
