# Winged Bull
*Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 214*  

Archons always ride into battle on fearsome winged mounts. Some legends suggest that the mount is actually a physical manifestation of the archon's will, allowing the pair to act with a single mind. The two most common archon mounts are winged bulls and winged lions.
