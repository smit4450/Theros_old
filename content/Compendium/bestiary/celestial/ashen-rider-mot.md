# Ashen Rider
*Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 213*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/celestial/img/ashen-rider.webp#right)  
The fall of the ancient archon empires left some archons bitter and resentful. Seeking to avoid the spread of human civilization, these archons made their way to the Underworld. The horrors of the place broke their minds, bodies, and spirits and twisted them into the terrifying archons known as ashen riders. When they ride forth upon the mortal world, terrified mortals make offerings in a desperate attempt to appease them, but the ashen riders aren't merciful, and they delight in reducing the paragons of the mortal world to ash.

The mysterious conquerors known as archons once ruled vast empires. These armored warlords saw themselves as champions of merciless justice, and they ruled with iron fists. But their dominance ultimately came to an end. As the archon overlords toppled, they scattered to the fringes of the world, and their holdings developed into the poleis of today.

Even though the age of archons is long past, many wonder if the few surviving archons might someday attempt to reestablish their empire or if they are truly resigned to their lesser role in the world.
