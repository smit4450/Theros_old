## Specter

*Spirit of Wrath and Servant of Death*

- **Habitat.** Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Specters are bodiless, life-devouring spirits drawn to darkness and negative emotions. Having lost all connection to the beings they once were, these hateful spirits drain mortal essence to steal fleeting tastes of life and warmth.

Specters seek creatures and locations that exude evil and feed on the suffering they inspire. Roll on or choose a result from the Specter Haunts table to inspire where a specter lurks.
