## Flameskull

*Skull Smoldering with Magical Obsession*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](Compendium/tables/random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

Flameskulls are flying skulls that blaze with magical fire and the half-remembered arcana of dead spellcasters. They rise from the remains of dead magic-users who were reanimated by sinister necromancers or whose magical pursuits drive them beyond death. Flameskulls might serve as guardians for their creators or pursue ambitions left unfulfilled in life. They lash out at foes with destructive spells and bursts of fire, wielding magic without the need for most components.

Flameskulls take various forms, from skulls with humanlike features to ones with fearsome or bestial alterations. Their flames vary in color and grow more intense when they're angry. Roll on or choose a result from the Flameskull Details table to inspire what makes a flameskull distinctive.
