# Ghast
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 130*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/undead/img/ghast.webp#right)  
Ghasts frequently organize ghouls into packs to despoil crypts and steal the wealth within.

## Ghasts

*Tyrants among Corpses*

- **Habitat.** Swamp, Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Ghasts are reeking, undying corpses closely related to ghouls. They hunger for the vices they enjoyed in life as much as they do for rotting flesh.
