# Death Knight
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 92*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/undead/img/death-knight.webp#right)  
Death knights are deadly combatants and domineering commanders with grim histories. Some strive to end the curses that doom them to undeath, though their selfish souls eternally shackle them to their fates. Others, like the infamous death knight Lord Soth, brood in dismal ruins for centuries, rousing themselves to action only when something reignites their deathless evil.

## Death Knights

*Haunted Commanders of Unliving Legions*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Champions of evil, death knights are armor-clad, skeletal warlords. Combining devastating martial prowess and blasphemous magic, these undying tyrants lead unholy legions against the living or brood in cursed citadels. Every death knight is haunted by a legacy of tragedy and dishonor that drives it to commit greater evils.
