# Cyclops Oracle
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 88*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/giant/img/cyclopes.webp#right)  
Cyclops oracles gaze through history to learn hidden truths. Many share these secrets with those who aid them in correcting the mistakes of the past.

## Cyclopes

*Monocular Servants of Destiny*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Desert, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Underdark

Cyclopes are gigantic, one-eyed descendants of the gods. Using their mystical vision, cyclopes can witness how future events are likely to occur.
