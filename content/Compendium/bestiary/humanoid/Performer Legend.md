![](Compendium/bestiary/humanoid/img/performers.webp#right)  
Performer legends are celebrities known across nations, continents, or worlds. Their prestige might grant them access to the heights of society, or they might use their performances to manipulate audiences. Performer legends usually have signature traits or talents that set them apart from other entertainers, such as a distinct voice, incredible athleticism, or a unique manner of dress. They often travel with a retinue of other performers, guards, or noble patrons.
