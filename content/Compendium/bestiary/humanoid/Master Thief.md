# Master Thief
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 216, Mythic Odysseys of Theros*

Master thieves are known for perpetrating daring heists. They tend to develop a reputation and a cult of personality. A master thief might "retire" from hands-on work to run a thieves' guild, spearhead some covert enterprise, or enjoy a quiet life of luxury.
