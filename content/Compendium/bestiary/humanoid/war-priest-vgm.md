# War Priest
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 218, Mythic Odysseys of Theros*  

War priests worship deities of war and combat. They plan tactics, lead soldiers into battle, confront enemy spellcasters, and tend to casualties. A war priest might command an army or serve as a warlord's right hand on the battlefield.
