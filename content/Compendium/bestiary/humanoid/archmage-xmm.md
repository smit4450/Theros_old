# Archmage
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 199*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/humanoid/img/archmage.webp#right)  
Archmages have mastered incredible magical power. While some use their magic to protect the world, others become tyrants or pursue forbidden secrets. Many archmages retain magical servants and collect magic items and occult lore.
