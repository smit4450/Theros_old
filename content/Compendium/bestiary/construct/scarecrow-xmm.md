# Scarecrow

## Scarecrow

*Servant of Superstition*

- **Habitat.** Grassland  
- **Treasure.** None  

Spirits of vengeance bound to crude frames, scarecrows arise from folk magic, the prayers of desperate commoners, or possession by spirits that died with violent work left undone. Scarecrows might serve those who created them or might defend a place, family, or community from threats—whether physical or to their way of life.

Although scarecrows take their name from rural effigies, they might take varied patchwork forms. Roll on or choose a result from the Scarecrow Frames table to inspire a scarecrow's appearance.
