# Gas Spore Fungus
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 125*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/plant/img/gas-spore-fungus.webp#right)  
Gas spores are floating, orbicular fungi with rhizome growths and protuberances that resemble the stalks and eyes of beholders. If destroyed, a gas spore explodes in a poisonous burst that can infect creatures and slay them in hours. Infected corpses spawn more gas spores that grow to full size in a matter of days.

## Fungi

*Deadly Spores and Predatory Polyps*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

The dank, sunless Underdark is a fertile breeding ground for weird and dangerous fungi.
