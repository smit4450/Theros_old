# Satyr
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 268, FRHoF. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

![](Compendium/bestiary/fey/img/satyrs.webp#right)  
Satyrs enjoy demonstrating their physicality through contests, evicting party poopers, and defending Fey realms.

## Satyrs

*Horned and Hoofed Revelers*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Planar (Feywild)  
- **Treasure.** [[random-magic-items-implements]]  

Satyrs embody the untamed joys of the wilderness. They indulge in sprees of merrymaking—eating, drinking, performing, fighting, and frolicking.
